Example code to create an AWS environment via Bitbucket CI/CD pipline in Bitbucket using Terraform. Leverages Vault for Secret Management and an S3 Remate Backend for central State management.

This example will also require a funcional instance of Vault with working secrets (or a small rewrite passing variables from within the repository variables).
